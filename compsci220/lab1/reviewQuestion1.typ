Short Answer

1. Why is the CPU the most important component in a computer?
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the most important component in a computer because it performs all the instructions and calculations that are needed for the computer to operate. It acts as the brain of the computer, executing commands from both hardware and software.

2. What number does a bit that is turned on represent? What number does a bit that is turned off represent?
A bit that is turned on represents the number 1. A bit that is turned off represents the number 0.

3. What would you call a device that works with binary data?
A device that works with binary data is called a digital device.

4. What are the words that make up a high-level programming language called?
The words that make up a high-level programming language are called keywords.

5. What are the short words that are used in assembly language called?
The short words that are used in assembly language are called mnemonics.

6. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
A compiler translates a high-level language program into a separate machine language program, which can then be executed independently of the original source code. An interpreter, on the other hand, translates and executes the instructions in a high-level language program line by line, without producing a separate machine language program.

7. What type of software controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware?
The type of software that controls the internal operations of the computer’s hardware is called an operating system.
