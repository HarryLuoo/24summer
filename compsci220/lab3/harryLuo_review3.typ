Short Answer
1. Explain what is meant by the term “conditionally executed.”
Conditionally executed means that a statement or block of code will only be executed if a certain condition is true.

2. Explain how a single alternative decision structure and a dual alternative decision structure differ.
A single alternative decision structure (if statement) executes a block of code if a condition is true; otherwise, it does nothing. A dual alternative decision structure (if-else statement) executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if the condition is false.

3. Briefly describe how the and operator works.
The `and` operator combines two Boolean expressions and returns True only if both expressions are true; otherwise, it returns False.

4. Briefly describe how the or operator works.
The `or` operator combines two Boolean expressions and returns True if at least one of the expressions is true; otherwise, it returns False.

5. When determining whether a number is outside a range, which logical operator is it best to use?
It is best to use the `or` operator when determining if a number is outside a range.

6. What is a flag and how does it work?
A flag is a Boolean variable that signals when a specific condition exists in the program. It is typically used to indicate the presence or absence of a particular state or condition, and its value can be checked to control the flow of the program.
