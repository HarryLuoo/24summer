Short Answer
1. What does a professional programmer usually do first to gain an understanding of a problem?
A professional programmer typically starts by analyzing the requirements and specifications of the problem to understand what needs to be solved.

2. How does pseudocode differ from actual code written in a programming language?
Pseudocode is a high-level description of an algorithm that uses plain language to outline the steps. It does not follow the syntax of any specific programming language.

3. Computer programs typically perform what three steps?
Computer programs typically perform input, processing, and output.

4. What rules and considerations should influence the names given to variables in a program?
Variable names should be descriptive, meaningful, and follow the naming conventions of the programming language. They should not contain spaces, start with a number, or use reserved keywords.

5. What is the difference between floating-point division and integer division?
Floating-point division (using /) returns a decimal or fractional result, whereas integer division (using \//) returns the quotient without the remainder.

6. What is a magic number? Why are magic numbers problematic?
A magic number is an unexplained numeric value that appears in a program's code. They are problematic because they make the code harder to understand and maintain. Using named constants instead of magic numbers improves code readability and maintainability.


7. Assume a program uses the named constant PI to represent the value 3.14159. The program uses the named constant in several statements. What is the advantage of using 
the named constant instead of the actual value 3.14159 in each statement?

Using the named constant PI instead of the actual value 3.14159 improves code readability, maintainability, consistency, and ease of modification by allowing changes to the value in one location rather than multiple places throughout the code.
